# Seven and a Half Rules

### ...to becoming great at anything you do

These are the seven and a half rules I spoke about in my [slide presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/gaylin/the-making-of-writing-black-belts-how-martial-arts-philosophy-forged-an-ad-hoc-writing-team-that-writes-great-docs) at my talk for [Write the Docs NA 2015](http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2015/):

1. **Find a good teacher** or get a good education.
1. **Be patient.** It takes time to become good at anything.
1. **Persevere.** It takes consistency to become good as well.
1. **Practice hard.** It's not going to be easy.
1. **Practice exactly what you want to perform.** There's no room for "well, we would really do this other thing."
1. **Still your mind.** Find your pause button to clear away the chaos of thought that clutters your brain.
1. **Make it your passion.** You've got to love it.

and [7.5](/why-only-seven-and-a-half-rules.md): 

**Shout it from the roofops.** In any endeavor, the best way to attract and encourage high quality partners is to shout it from the rooftops.
