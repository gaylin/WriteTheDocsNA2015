# Why 7.5 rules? Why not 8?

Anyone reading these repository notes (or the talk abstract) will immediately wonder about the numbering of the rules and think "Why only 7.5 rules? Why not 8?". I don't have a great answer.

My Sifu (martial arts teacher) explained to us that, for many years, he frequently asked other instructors and students to come up with rules that didn't fit into the 7 he'd already mapped out. It was a very long time before he had a group of fellow martial artists finally convince him there was a rule missing.

Philosophy of the "Self" aside (that's a whole different talk, my friends), I believe that something can really only approach the status of "Art" when it's shared and a bond is formed or strengthened. For the purposes of this talk, I like to think of the martial arts bond as the bond between partners as they practice. In the case of technical communication, I like to think of it as the bond between writers and readers.

Although he's never said it, perhaps my Sifu lists the last rule as number 7.5 instead of number 8 because it wasn't truly him who came up with it. Maybe he only added it with the help of others, so he'll only take partial credit for its inclusion. Ultimately, I'll have to find the right time to ask him (again) for the reason. Or at least the reason he's willing to give me at that moment.
