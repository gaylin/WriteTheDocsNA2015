When people ask me why I started practicing martial arts, my answer varies. At the risk of exposing my age, the nutshell version is that I needed to find some better rules to live by after I got laid off from a job about a decade ago.

Today I work as the “Pied Piper of Documentation and Translator of Geek” at Fastly. Fastly is a startup company based in San Francisco and when I signed on, we had about 29 employees. I’m pretty sure I was number 30. 

Today we’re closing in on 170 full-time employees around the world, though I’m sure my math is a little off because we’re still hiring like crazy. However, here are some numbers you might find interesting.

This is how many people are on the official “documentation team.” In case you’re wondering, I’m the one without the beard.

And this is how many people are actually trained technical writers actively writing docs. However…

This is how many potential documentation writers we have: ~170. Yes, that’s effectively everyone at the company. Realistically, does everyone in the company actually write documentation? Not yet.

But our core belief is that everyone at our company can and should be able to write docs. In fact, we believe it so strongly that we’ve started structuring of our new employee onboarding around it, beginning with our customer support group (with little overlap into our engineering teams as each of them complete a rotation in customer support).

We’re still feeling our way around a bit as we grow, but everything we’re putting into place follows seven and a half rules. And they’re the same rules I was taught when I first started learning martial arts.

Rule number one: find a good teacher or get a good education. 

When I started practicing martial arts, I happened to be lucky enough to have a dojo nearby where I could study with a long-time martial arts master. From the very first day I stepped on the mats, I had someone by my side, either my Sifu (my teacher) or an advanced student, showing me what they meant by “Breathe. Put your foot here. Move your arms this way.” 

At Fastly, we mentor people by immediately assigning them a buddy on day one of their job. For a brief time, we tried having a single person serve as the mentor for all new employees, but we found they often focused their efforts on just the people who seemed to be floundering. Employees who might not be as visible or vocal with their problems didn’t get as much attention. A one-on-one mentoring approach worked better and turns out to be a lot more scalable as we grow exponentially. 

Rule number two: be patient.

My Sifu likes to say “You can’t get in shape overnight.” He also frequently talks about how you shouldn’t expect a black belt within a year or two either. The simple fact is getting good at martial arts takes time. We have to learn what our bodies can and cannot do. We need to fall down a few times to understand “oh, right, I need to get out of the way of that punch or kick.” Every single student of martial arts learns patience this way. Even after eight and half years, I still fall down. A lot.

So how do we teach that patience in our work? At my company, we do it by insisting that new employees immediately start playing with our software, our services, and our documentation. With their mentoring buddy by their side, they set things up and configure them as if they were a new customer, and immediately experience most of the same frustrations that new customers experience right from the start.

Patience isn’t the only thing born from the empathy of “I’ve been through this too.” Learning this way gives us better docs because it encourages our writers to immediately ask “Why? Why am I doing this?” and “What kind of document could have prevented this frustration?”.

Rule number three: persevere.

At first glance this might seem to duplicate rule two, but think of it this way. It’s not just that it takes time to become great at something, it’s consistency too. Being a great martial artist means understanding that you can’t just show up to the dojo every couple of months and throw a few punches and kicks and call it good. You need to show up consistently, from the very beginning, even when it’s difficult.

At Fastly, our writers begin touching the documentation from day one. For example, working side-by-side with their mentoring buddy, new employees in our customer support group immediately begin answering customer support tickets. From day one they work to actively point out at least one of piece of documentation whenever it’s appropriate in every ticket they answer.

This brings us to rule number four: practice hard.

When we train in martial arts we expect to push ourselves to take on more than we ever thought possible. My Sifu calls this “more” concept “breaking through our limitations.” When we practice hard and break through these limitations, we can take on challenges far greater than we ever thought possible.

So how does this translate to working on documentation at Fastly? Within their first two weeks, employees work with their buddy to submit a completely new guide or significant change to our documentation. In addition to monitoring incoming support tickets where they point people to our docs, they also monitor our community forums where their answers get converted into new docs. I could list more but it all amounts to a ton of work in communication all within the first month employment.

But here’s the thing. With such intense and constant focus on communication and documentation, we’ve found that employees have tackled some amazingly complex topics very early in their employment, when they might have otherwise shied away from them. They’ve turned some really dense info into succinct, easy to follow guides that are among our most popular documentation pieces to date. 

Rule number five: practice exactly what you want to perform.

At the dojo I attend, we’re trained from day one to keep our hands up in a good guard when we fight. We train that way so that should the worst happen and we have to fight in real life, our muscles will automatically respond with what we’ve taught them to do all along. There won’t be any hesitation. My Sifu likes to say that there’s no room for doing one thing and then saying “Well we would REALLY do this instead.”

I think it’s safe to say that none of my coworkers expect to be able to write a letter home to mom and have it count as a company service guide any more than we would expect playing Arkham Asylum to teach us about kung fu or hand-to-hand combat in the real world. 

All that work our customer support folk do to answer tickets with documentation links? It’s real work. All that effort they put in to creating new docs and updating existing ones? That’s real work too. All of it is real work on things we actually need. And customers get to see it right away the vast majority of the time.

Rule number six: still your mind.

I have to confess that it wasn’t until some time last night in my hotel room that I could articulate this idea. You see, I have a very bad habit of speaking before my brain is fully engaged. And I found that I did the same thing in my practice of martial arts. And in my technical writing. What I needed most was to find my own pause button to clear the chaos.

At the risk of becoming granola crunchy on this topic, the best way for me to find my pause button is to breathe and meditate. My Sifu says this: “Meditation is the foundation of all true arts. To still and thus control the mind is of the utmost importance.”

Each person’s approach to this at my company is a bit different. For some of my writers, their pause button may involve playing a game of soccer (we have a company team). For others it may be reading (we have a company book club). The key point here is that every single writer on our team is supported by the company culture to “find their bliss” and take the time they need to “find their happy place” in whatever way that works best for them even if it means taking time off from work to do it.

Rule number seven: make it your passion.

My Sifu likes to quote a martial arts master who once said “You need two things in life: something to live for and something to die for. You are very fortunate if they are the same thing.”

Regardless of what you’re doing, be it writing or martial arts, you’ve got to love it. In martial arts, it’s passion keeps you going to the dojo two or three times a week for five months straight after shoulder surgery, even though you can only observe and not even step through the basic techniques. (Incidentally that was my life from last August through March of this year.)

Now while we’re certainly not advocating giving up your entire life to your company, at Fastly, passion about what we do plays a huge role in the quality of the writing. Beginning employees have a great deal of freedom in choosing the documentation they create or update. We don’t specifically assign them a topic and say “Here, write about this” because we want them to have fun and enjoy what they’re writing about. As they gain more confidence in their writing and taste that bit of success having published something, we’ve found that employees naturally start seeking out more ways to contribute.

Rule number seven and a half: shout it from the rooftops.

To become great martial artist, you must have partners to practice with. It’s not enough to practice forms or to just attack a punching bag. If all you ever do is punch inanimate objects, you won’t understand what it’s like to work with a partner who moves. 

For any endeavor, the best way to attract partners, especially high quality ones, is to demonstrate the passion for the things you love and by shouting that passion from the rooftops for everyone to hear.

This talk at Write the Docs is one of my shouts. And it’s just one of the many possibilities my company has for encouraging employees to explain and share exactly what it is they love about what they do and who they do it with. We’re constantly presenting at conferences in a variety of fields. We host and give talks at meet-ups like “Papers We Love.” We write blog posts and newsletter articles, both for Fastly as well as for other companies and organizations. And we contribute heavily to open source programs around the world.

So there you have it. Seven and a half rules for becoming a great martial artist, a great documentarian, or simply great at anything you do. Why seven and a half? Well, unfortunately I’m out of time. Please feel free to ask me in person the next time you see me. It’s also explained in my github repository if we don’t manage to connect before we all leave to head back home.

Thank you.
